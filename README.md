TL;DR: One-to-one propensity score matching analysis to match bilingual and monolingual older adults on brain health.

Full explanation:
This study was based on a finding from Anderson et al. (2018) that showed older adult cognitively normal bilinguals had poorer white matter health than their monolingual peers.
This worse brain health was seen despite similar education and performance on cognitive tasks.
These bilinguals were used in the current study and matched against a larger sample of monolinguals taken from the Alzheimer's Disease and Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database.
White matter measures were determined using diffusion-tensor imaging, and one-to-one propensity score matching was used to match monolinguals from ADNI and bilinguals from the community on brain health (determined using principal component analysis of white matter measures), education, sex, and age.
Critically, monolinguals taken from ADNI had clinical diagnoses of normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment, or Alzheimer's. The bilinguals were all cognitively normal.
The monolinguals who were matched to bilinguals had worse clinical and cognitive outcomes than by chance alone as seen by a one proportion null distribution.
